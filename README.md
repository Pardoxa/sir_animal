Source code of the publication "Rare Events of Host Switching for Diseases using a SIR Model with Mutations"

The code is written with Rust and should work on Linux with Rust version 1.70.0.
You need to have "make" and "m4" installed.
It can be compiled via
```bash
cargo b -r
```

Note that many sumcommands output default config files when run without a config file.
Try the `--help`  option for more infos in those cases.

If something is unclear do not hesitate to post an issue.

All code was written by Yannick Feld
